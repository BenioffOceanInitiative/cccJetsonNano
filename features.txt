GUI would be great

need to be able to load new weights easily

 - potentially have it check a directory for new weights and load them in
 - could also have it check for new weights every day or something
 - maybe an auto update feature?

need to be able to modify the upload URL for data uploads during tracking
 - possibly a config file?


need to be able to change tracking parameters such as the threshold for image upload and object counting

need a way to change the camera settings
 - exposure
 - gain
 - resolution
 - framerate
 - etc

need a way to enbale or disable video display/recording

need a way to enable gpio pins for triggering the tracking program
